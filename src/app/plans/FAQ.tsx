					<FAQQestion>Why is there a one-time fee?</FAQQestion>
					<FAQAnswer>
						The one-time fee helps us invest early into better infrastructure,
						ultimately providing you with a better user experience.

				<FAQEntry>
					<FAQQestion>
						Why have a monthly payment and a one-time fee?
					</FAQQestion>
					<FAQAnswer>
						Resources aren&apos;t cheap. All reliable cloud-hosted databases
						require a monthly payment. The one-time fee helps us invest back
						into the application, while the monthly payment helps keep the doors
						open over time.
					</FAQAnswer>

				<FAQEntry>
					<FAQQestion>
						Why are the number of locations, products, etc. limited?
					</FAQQestion>
					<FAQAnswer>
						Cloud-hosted databases are expensive. Payments are calculated based
						on the amount of storage you use and the computing power you
						require. The more data you use, the higher the database bill. Thus,
						the number of resources you can use is limited to ensure your usage
						never exceeds the bill cost.

					<FAQQestion>
						Will I get charged another one-time fee if I upgrade from a lower
						plan to a higher plan?
					</FAQQestion>
					<FAQAnswer>
						No. You will only be charged the difference in monthly payments.

					<FAQQestion>
						Will my payment information be saved and sold?
					</FAQQestion>

							<ExternalLink className='w-2 h-2' />
						</a>{' '}
						to handle all payments. Your information is solely processed by
						Stripe and never sent to us. Therefore, we never have access to any
						of your payment details.
